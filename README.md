This project was created in the context of one day Hackathon at [Algolia](https://algolia.com/).
The goal was to get creative and produce a fun demo combining the 2D physics library [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)
and Algolia Search.

The code is at hackathon levels of cleanliness, so readers beware!
